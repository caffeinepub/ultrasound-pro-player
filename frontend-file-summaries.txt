{
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Updated instrument-slider CSS to use padding trick for 44px touch targets while keeping 6px visual track height; added .instrument-card-active utility class for border glow; updated eq-slider dimensions to match new 44×130px overlay; all other global styles, animations, and glassmorphism utilities preserved.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Tailwind config extended with Orbitron/Rajdhani/Inter font families, custom ultra-gold/blue/dark color tokens, neon glow box-shadow variants, and standard shadcn/ui token mappings.",
  "frontend/src/utils/audioConstants.ts": "Defines the 20 EQ frequency bands, gain limits, frequency labels, and 4 sound engine presets (Crystal, Deep Bass, Surround, Pure HD) as gain arrays.",
  "frontend/src/utils/instrumentMappings.ts": "Strict 1-to-1 mapping of 20 instruments to 20 EQ bands — each instrument owns exactly one band index (no sharing), ordered from lowest to highest frequency (Conga=band0 through Cymbals=band19). Exports BAND_INDEX_TO_INSTRUMENT_INDEX lookup array for O(1) reverse lookup.",
  "frontend/src/utils/debounce.ts": "Generic debounce utility function for wrapping EQ and instrument slider onChange handlers to prevent audio clicks.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useAudioEngine.ts": "Web Audio API engine hook — `initializeContext` is now fully async and properly awaits `AudioContext.resume()` before returning, ensuring the context is in 'running' state before playback starts. All other filter chain, gain, analyser, and source connection logic is preserved.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useBatteryCharging.ts": "Battery charging state hook using requestAnimationFrame to animate 0–100% charge over 12 seconds, tracking wattage counter, output power, and unlock status.",

  "frontend/src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts": "Audio playback hook refactored so `play()` is async — it awaits `initializeContext()`, awaits `ctx.resume()` if still suspended, connects the source, then awaits `audio.play()` with full error handling. `loadTrack` now accepts an optional `autoPlay` flag to start playback immediately after loading. Adds `playbackError` to state and a `clearError` method.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useCanvasAnimation.ts": "Simple requestAnimationFrame loop hook with start/stop controls for canvas-based animations.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "Empty placeholder file since this app is entirely client-side with no backend queries.",

  "frontend/src/components/Playlist.tsx": "Playlist updated to accept and use `playbackState` prop to animate the active track indicator (pulsing ▶ when playing), and imports `PlaybackState` type from the player hook.",
  "frontend/src/components/PlayerControls.tsx": "Player controls updated to display a dismissible error banner when `playerState.playbackError` is set, and accepts the new `onClearError` prop. All other layout and battery-lock logic is preserved.",

  "frontend/src/components/InstrumentControls.tsx": "Grid of 20 instrument sliders (Bass Guitar through Harmonica) that boost/cut linked EQ bands with color-coded highlighting and bidirectional visual feedback.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main app component updated so `handleTrackSelect` auto-plays on track click when battery is unlocked (toggles play/pause if same track is re-clicked), passes `playbackState` to Playlist, and passes `onClearError` to PlayerControls.",
  "frontend/src/components/EQStabilizer.tsx": "Named-exported EQStabilizer component that renders 20 EQ bands and 20 instrument cards in a 4-rows-of-5-columns grid layout (no horizontal scrolling), with each cell containing a compact vertical EQ slider (top) and a vertical instrument gain slider with icon and name (bottom), preserving all bidirectional 1-to-1 EQ↔instrument sync and Web Audio BiquadFilterNode wiring."
