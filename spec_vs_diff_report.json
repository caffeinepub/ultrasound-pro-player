  "summary": "The diff implements all three required features (REQ-26, REQ-27, REQ-28) with dedicated components: BluetoothSpeakerDisplay.tsx, ProcessorPage.tsx, SoundMagnet.tsx, SoundMagnetToggle.tsx, and useSoundMagnet.ts hook. The App.tsx integrates all components with tab navigation. Most acceptance criteria appear to be met, with a few minor gaps identified due to file truncation.",
