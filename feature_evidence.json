      "featureTitle": "Build a Bluetooth Speaker Display panel that shows 2–3 animated Bluetooth speaker illustrations on screen. The panel displays live output data routed through the app's current audio settings: output power in watts and dB level being sent to the speaker, updated in real time from the Web Audio API analyser/gain node. Each speaker illustration renders an animated speaker cone that pulses and moves in sync with the music (scale or displacement driven by the current audio amplitude). The panel is titled 'BLUETOOTH SPEAKER OUTPUT' and uses the existing dark glassmorphism card style with gold/blue glow accents.",

      "featureTitle": "Build a 'Sound Magnet — Stimulation Virtual Music Magnifier' feature. Render a large animated circular/radial field visualization in the center panel (or as an overlay) that grows in size as the audio volume/amplitude increases, simulating the sound filling the room. The magnet field must be visually much larger than a speaker — it represents the room being filled. The field animation uses concentric glowing rings or a pulsing radial gradient in gold/yellow that expand outward with volume. The feature has a clearly visible ON/OFF toggle switch labeled 'SOUND MAGNET'. When OFF, the animation is hidden. This feature is designed for small speakers (e.g. any small Bluetooth speaker) to make the audio feel larger than the physical speaker. The amplitude data is read from the existing Web Audio API AnalyserNode.",
