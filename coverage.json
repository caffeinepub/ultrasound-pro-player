        "summary": "Fix the audio playback pipeline so that when a user selects audio files via the file picker (drag-and-drop or browse) and clicks a track in the playlist, the audio actually plays. The issue is that files can be selected and appear in the playlist but clicking Play or selecting a track does not produce any sound. Ensure the object URL created from the selected File is correctly assigned to the HTMLAudioElement src, the AudioContext is resumed (it may be in 'suspended' state due to browser autoplay policy), the source node is connected to the audio engine filter chain, and the play() promise is awaited and any rejection is caught and logged.",
